# Galaxia Core

A Decentralized Finance Platform for the Galaxy

Galaxia Core is the backbone of the Galaxia decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, providing a modular and extensible framework for building decentralized applications (dApps) and services.

## Overview

Galaxia Core is a Python-based framework that leverages the Cosmos-SDK and Tendermint consensus engine to provide a high-performance and scalable platform for DeFi applications. The framework is designed to be modular, allowing developers to easily add or remove components as needed.

## Components

Galaxia Core consists of the following components:

1. galaxia: The core framework for building DeFi applications and services.
2. extensions: A collection of extension modules for adding new features and functionality to the framework.
3. services: A set of service layers for interacting with external systems, APIs, and databases.
4. models: Data models and schema definitions for the framework.
4. views: View templates and rendering engines for generating user interfaces.

## Features

1. Modular architecture: Galaxia Core is designed to be modular, allowing developers to easily add or remove components as needed.
2. High-performance: The framework is built on top of the Cosmos-SDK and Tendermint consensus engine, providing high-performance and scalability.
3. Extensible: Galaxia Core provides a range of extension points, allowing developers to easily add new features and functionality.
4. Decentralized governance: The framework is designed to support decentralized governance models, enabling community-driven decision-making and development.
